Hi there! I'm a nutritionist based in Crouch End, London. I offer
nutritional counseling both online and in-person. You can 
[book a free intro call](https://calendly.com/n8-nutrition/15min) 
or get in touch at info@n8nutrition.com for more information.

I have a background in Clinical Nutrition focusing on the complex
interplay between nutrition, disease and health. In my counseling, I
lean towards a pragmatic, evidence-based approach. This generally
means avoiding specific diets and dramatic or short-term lifestyle
changes.
