I grew up in Iceland and lived there until year 2000. I moved
to Denmark to study Medicin before finding my passion in
Nutrition. 

Today I live in Crouch End, London with my husband and 3 boys. As a
busy mum I know how difficult it can be to prioritise your own health
and well-being. I take this knowledge into my practice and will often
focus on small incremental changes, leading to sustainable long term
changes.

##### Professionel Experience

I obtained my Masters degree in Clinical Nutrition in 2015, which
included working alongside dietitians in the Danish healthcare
system. The Masters degree in Clinical Nutrition is primarily focused
on working alongside doctors and dietitians in a clinical setting.

Today, I help individuals and families with many different
challenges. I am particularly passionate about the wellbeing and
lifestyles of children.
