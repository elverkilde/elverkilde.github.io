I have several years of experience in lifestyle and nutrition
coaching. Below you can see my standard services, but don't be afraid
to get in touch to discuss your specific needs.

## Nutrition Coaching

Whether you are making a lifestyle change, adjust to new dietary
requirements or just looking for inspiration, I have helped many in a
similar situation.

Normally we will discuss your needs in an introductory call and create
a plan. I offer discounts for 10 sessions or more.

## Baking courses

As a nutritionist, I know bread has gotten a bad reputation recently
but I personally couldn't live without bread in my diet.

I bake my own sourdough bread as well as traditional Danish rye
bread. I love sharing this passion and provide group courses,
including childrens courses in half terms.
